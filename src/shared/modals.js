              SpotiFeed provides a way for Spotify users to see the recent uploads of their followed artists in a news-feed style display. Once signed in, the app allows the user to log into their Spotify account and then pulls their followed artists, finds their most recent singles and albums, and displays them in descending chronological order.

          <Row className='modal-mid-text-content'>
            <p>
              Once the most recent tracks have been pulled, the user is able to create their own playlists to store their favorite tracks. They can name their playlists as they like, add and remove songs and albums as they please, and their playlists will remain unchanged as their recent uploads evolve over time.

              The end result is an app that lets users stay up-to-date with their favorite artists without the hassle of checking in on them one at a time.

              Note: Because SpotiFeed is still an app in development, each Spotify user&apos;s email must be registered before use. To get around this, I&apos;ve created a &apos;dummy&apos; Spotify account that can be used for testing, or you can reach out and I&apos;ll add your email to the list! Shoot me a message via the &apos;Contact&apos; section to learn more.

            Designed using React, this website is a portfolio piece in itself! As my time at General Assembly has waned, I chose to apply the new front-end techniques I have learned to design a modern, responsive representation of my work.

            I wanted to design something interactive, and something that at a glance looked like it was done professionally, without spending weeks on it. React offered a great way to do this, creating components for the major visual blocks and using the React-Bootstrap library for some of the more dynamic elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website organizes each major visual block as a React component, and uses Modals for all of the pop-up display features. Additional styling is done in SCSS to add some flavor to the site. The finished product is a simple yet organized representation of my front-end skills, and of my creative design side as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course there is always room for improvement, so if you have any suggestions, please drop me a message in the contact section below. Any and all feedback is appreciated!
